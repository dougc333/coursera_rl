Some issues: 
1) when building a system in the real world. A delayed reward violates the markov assumption where the t-1 state contains all the relevant state 
2) Open Bandit framework is an example of counterfactual policies. If you pull arm 2, what would happen if there was an arm3 and it was pulled. How to anayze this from historical log data? this requires off policy material
